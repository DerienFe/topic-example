# Chess: science, sport or art?

If you were to choose one adjective for chess which one would you choose? 
Perhaps you think none of these adjectives go with the term "chess", and you'd rather just 
define it as a game. If that's the case, why do you think it can't be considered any of the above?

There is no point in this

The reasons are:

1. Nobody is interested in this question
2. There is no useful endpoint on answering this question
3. I'd rather do sth more useful
